// The way this works, when the dialog is opened from a web page, it opens
// the window with a #host=<requesting_host_name> parameter in its URL.
// window.setupChannel is called automatically when the dialog is opened. We
// assume that navigator.id.getVerifiedEmail was the function called, we will
// keep this assumption until we start experimenting.  Since IE has some
// serious problems iwth postMessage from a window to a child window, we are now
// communicating not directly with the calling window, but with an iframe
// on the same domain as us that we place into the calling window.  We use a
// function within this iframe to relay messages back to the calling window.
// We do so by searching for the frame within the calling window, and then
// getting a reference to the proxy function.  When getVerifiedEmail is
// complete, it calls the proxy function in the iframe, which then sends a
// message back to the calling window.
